# Text_summarization
In this  we have Evaluated three openLLMs for text summarization and at last we have recomended the best one of them .
the three openLLMs are : 
  1. t5-small
  2. facebook/bart-base
  3. facebook/bart-large-xsum
Here we have used the ROUGE score as the evaluation matrics to evaluate the performance of the models .
**ROUGE score** , used to evaluate the quality of the machine genrated text compared to the human genrated text (i.e. reference_summary). ROUGE stands for Recall-oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation .
